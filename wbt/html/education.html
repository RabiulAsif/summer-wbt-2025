            I completed my SSC at Dhangora Model High School with a GPA of 5.00, ranking among the top performers in my
            class. In addition to excelling academically, I was actively engaged in scouting activities.

            As a committed scout, I participated in school-level, area-level, and national-level events, including the
            National Scout event in Panchagarh in 2012. These experiences helped me develop leadership, teamwork, and
            problem-solving skills, which continue to influence my personal and professional growth.

            I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at AIUB. This program has
            provided me with a strong foundation in programming, software development, and system design. I have
